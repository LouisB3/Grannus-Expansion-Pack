# Grannus Expansion Pack

Grannus Expansion Pack (GEP) is an planet pack that turns a single star system into a binary system by adding the red dwarf star Grannus, along with its family of five major planets, two dwarf planets, and seven moons.

GEP is designed to provide several installation options. It can be added to the stock solar system, Galileo's Planet Pack (GPP), or JNSQ. It also works in combination with Outer Planets Mod (OPM).  And with the optional add-on GEP_Primary, GEP takes center stage as the primary star system, with the planet Nodens as the home world.

## Requirements

  * [Kopernicus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases)
  * ModularFlightIntegrator
  * Module Manager

## Installation Instructions

1. Begin with an installation of KSP version 1.8.1 or later, running in 64-bit.

2. If reusing an existing install, empty the GameData folder of all contents but for the folder [KSP]\GameData\Squad\. If starting with an entirely new install, is it recommended that you run KSP once with no mods installed before proceeding.

3. Download the third party mod [Kopernicus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases). The Kopernicus version number must match the KSP version number, e.g. 1.8.1-x.

4. Install by copying from [Kopernicus Download]\GameData\ to [KSP]\GameData\ the following folders and files:  
   * Kopernicus
   * ModularFlightIntergrator
   * ModuleManager

5. If installing with [Galileo's Planet Pack](https://github.com/Galileo88/Galileos-Planet-Pack/releases) or [JNSQ](https://github.com/Galileo88/JNSQ/releases), it is recommended that you download and install those mods first, and confirm their correct operation before installing GEP. Be sure to carefully follow all the GPP or JNSQ installation instructions.

6. Download Grannus Expansion Pack v1.2.3.

7. Copy from [GEP Download]\GameData\ to [KSP]\GameData\ the folder GEP and all its contents.

## GEP_Primary

GEP_Primary is an optional add-on that turns GEP into a primary star system, with Grannus as the central star and Nodens the home world. If GEP + GEP_Primary is installed in combination with GPP + GPP_Secondary, then GPP is added as a secondary star system orbiting Grannus. GEP_Primary is not recommended for beginner players.

To install GEP_Primary:

1. Download and install Grannus Expansion Pack per the installation instructions.

2. Copy [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_Primary\GameData\GEP_Primary to [KSP]\GameData\ .

3. For implementation of anomalies, download and install [Kerbal Konstructs](https://github.com/GER-Space/Kerbal-Konstructs/releases).

## GEP_Rescale

GEP_Rescale is an optional config that rescales the GEP solar system to 2.5x its normal size, for use in combination with either GEP_Primary or the JNSQ planet pack. Rescaling is accomplished without the use of Sigma Dimensions. If GEP is used in any installation where Sigma Dimensions is used to perform rescaling, then GEP_Rescale should not be installed.

To install GEP_Rescale:

1. Download and install Grannus Expansion Pack per the installation instructions.

2. If to be used with GEP_Primary, install GEP_Primary per the installation instructions above.

3. If to be used with JNSQ, download and install [JNSQ](https://github.com/Galileo88/JNSQ/releases) per the installation instructions.

4. Copy [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_Rescale\GameData\GEP_Rescale to [KSP]\GameData\ .

## GEP_CommNet

GEP_CommNet is an optional add-on that increases communications range by adding a level 4 Tracking Station and a powerful additional antenna. With both upgrades, a line of communication can reach between Grannus and the Sun/Ciro.

To install GEP_CommNet:

1. Download and install the third party mod [Custom Barn Kit](https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/CustomBarnKit/).

2. Copy/merge [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_CommNet\GameData\GEP to [KSP]\GameData\ .

## Other Optional Mods

Install the optional mods of your choice by copying or merging [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_[mod name]\GameData\[mod name] to [KSP]\GameData\ .

If using [Final Frontier](https://spacedock.info/mod/580/Final%20Frontier), it must be downloaded and installed separately.

## Bundled Mods

Sigma TweakChutes - Changes parachute behavior so that parachutes won't fully deploy unless the minimum pressure for semi-deployment has first been met. Also corrects a bug that allows the deployment pressure to be set below the intended minimum while in flight mode.

Sigma HeatShifter - Required to correctly align minimum and maximum global temperatures to the sun's directional axis for tidally locked atmospheric planets (Toutatis).

## Planet Pack Compatibility

GEP works with the stock solar system, [Galileo's Planet Pack](https://github.com/Galileo88/Galileos-Planet-Pack/releases), [Outer Planets Mod](https://github.com/Poodmund/Outer-Planets-Mod/releases), and [Minor Planets Expansion](https://spacedock.info/mod/2383/Minor%20Planets%20Expansion?ga=%3CGame+3102+%27Kerbal+Space+Program%27%3E) in a variety of configurations, both primary and secondary. Orbits are modified as necessary to assure seamless integration.

GEP also works with [JNSQ](https://github.com/Galileo88/JNSQ/releases) using the optional add-on GEP_Rescale (see instructions above). At present, GEP is the only planet pack known to be rescaled and configured specifically for use alongside JNSQ.
